# CodeAlpha_Project_Task-2_DATA-PREPROCESSING
This project is part of my internship with CodeAlpha. This repository contains a preprocessing pipeline for the Titanic dataset. The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, detecting and capping outliers, normalizing/scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
